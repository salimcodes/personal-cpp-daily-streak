/* Write a complete C++ Program that has a main function, a GetTwoNumbers
function and a FindBigOne function. The main calls the GetTwoNumbers functions,
which asks the user for two integers.
Then the program sends the two int's to FindBigOne, which returns the larger one
to main.

For example, if the user puts in 19 and 2, FindTheBigOne will return 19. If the two
numbers are the same, it will send back either one. Incorporate a loop in the main
function so that the user can keep entering two values as long as he or she desires
